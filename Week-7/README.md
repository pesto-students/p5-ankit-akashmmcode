q1reverseLinkedList.js
Reverse the given linked list.

q2RotateLinkedList.js
Rotate the given linked list

q3LoopDetection.js
Detect the loop in given linked list.

q4ParenthesisChecker.js
Given an expression string x. Examine whether the pairs and the orders of“{“,”}”,”(“,”)”,”[“,”]” are correct in exp.For example, the function should return 'true' for exp= “[()]{}{()()}” and 'false' for exp =“[(])

q5NextGreaterElement.js
Given an array arr{} of size N having distinct elements, the task is to find the nextgreater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array.
Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the rightwhich is greater than the current element. If there does not exist next greater of currentelement, then next greater element for current element is -1. For example, next greaterof the last element is always -1

q6QueueUsingStack.js
Implement a Queue using 2 stacks s1 and s2 . A Query Q is of 2 Types (i) 1 x (a queryof this type means pushing 'x' into the queue) (ii) 2 (a query of this type means to popelement from queue and print the poped element.
